This Visual Studio 2022 solution contains 2 projects that are the standard .NET MAUI "hello world". It is a reduced test case to demonstrate an issue we are having integrating the [Sentry.Maui](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Maui) package.

## How the Basic App was created
1. Opened Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
2. Create a new project > .NET MAUI Multi-Project App > Next
3. Configured New Project screen: used defaults > Next
4. Additional Information screen: unchecked Android, iOS and macOS and left only Windows using WinUI 3 checked on  > Create
5. confirmed I could run and see default main page with waving dotnet bot
